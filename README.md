## Introduction

MSST-GUI is a Qt5-based inference GUI, designed to provide a convenient and intuitive way to inference (mainly for my own use). At its core, it's a GUI that uses a specified Python environment to add parameters and call `inference.py`. As such, you can also package `msst_gui_en.py` as a smaller executable file and use it in the main repository.


![Main Interface](./images//demo1.png)

Inferences are executed sequentially on the target audio from top to bottom. For example, enabling Vocal Model, Karaoke Model, and Reverb Model for a song will directly yield the dry main vocal. Hover your mouse over the corresponding areas to see explanatory information.

![Configuration Editor](./images//demo2.png)

MSST-GUI also comes equipped with a configuration editor, allowing you to add and use your own models or edit existing ones. Models should be placed in the `pretrain` directory.
